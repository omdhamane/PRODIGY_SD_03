Contact Management System – GUI Based Application
📖 Project Description

This project is a GUI-based Contact Management System developed as part of the Software Development Internship at Prodigy Infotech.

The application allows users to add, view, update, and delete contacts. All contact data is stored locally using a JSON file to ensure data persistence even after the application is closed.

🛠 Technologies Used

Python 3

Tkinter (for GUI)

JSON (for data storage)

OS module (file handling)

📂 Data Storage

Contact data is stored in a file named contacts.json

The file is automatically created if it does not exist

Data is stored in a structured and readable JSON format

🖥 User Interface

The application follows a modern card-based layout with proper spacing, flat buttons, and a clean visual hierarchy to improve usability.
